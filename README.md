# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by analyzing their goals and challenges, then translating them into clear, actionable requirements. Creating user stories ensures the team understands what the user values, allowing us to design and implement features that align with their expectations.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development by breaking down tasks into manageable pieces and prioritizing iterative improvements. In the future, I plan to incorporate Agile processes like sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and regular retrospectives to maintain collaboration and adaptability.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means actively contributing, communicating effectively, and supporting others to achieve shared goals. It also involves taking responsibility for your work while fostering a collaborative and respectful team environment.
